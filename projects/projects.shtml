This project was initiated in an attempt to better understand the 
structure of the folded bacterial chromosome and the selective forces that 
have conserved the genetic map over the past 100 million years or so, since the 
divergence of <i>Salmonella</i> and <i>E. coli</i>.  We have found that duplications 
are frequent, well-tolerated and can be selectively valuable while 
inversions are rare and sometimes deleterious.  This has suggested that 
the recombination system of bacteria may be structured to minimize 
exchanges between inverse-order repeats.
<br><br>
In the course of this work, we have realized that rearrangements provide a 
very useful system for studying the process of recombination.  Repeated 
chromosomal sequences provide substrates that lack the double stranded 
ends provided by sexual assays and thus may more accurately reflect the 
role functions of recombination.  Duplications can be generated by 
half-exchanges while inversions require full (reciprocal) exchanges.  In 
addition, using inverse-order sequences we can recover both products of a 
recombination event, which is impossible in standard sexual assays.  These 
assays have provided some new ways of studying recombination.
<br><br>
We have also been using P22-mediated transduction to develop new 
recombination assays.  It is our general belief that there is still a role 
for genetic analysis in the study of recombination, and in assessing the 
biological role of known recombination proteins.

<left><h4>Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12)</h4></left>

This cofactor is unevenly distributed among living things, suggesting that 
it might be associated with particular lifestyles or growth conditions.  
We discovered that Salmonella dedicates about 1% of its genome to B12 
production and import, suggesting frequent use of the cofactor under 
natural conditions.  Under standard laboratory conditions, there is no 
growth phenotype associated with B12 deficiency.  We are using genetics to 
approach the synthetic pathway of B12 and it's regulation.  We are also 
trying to understand the importance of B12 to natural populations.  In 
doing this we are working on two B12-dependent processes -- breakdown of 
ethanolamine and propanediol.  Operons for both of these processes are 
being intensively studied.

<TD><center><h2>Recycling of NAD</h2></center></TD>
</TR></TABLE>
<left><h4>NAD+</h4></left>

While NAD is well known as an electron carrier, it also energizes DNA 
ligation.  We are trying to understand the synthesis and recycling of NAD 
and how it relates to energy metabolism, DNA repair and oxidative stress.  
The large NAD pool is subject to breakdown to NMN which is recycled to NAD 
through two pathways.  The ligase-dependent NAD breakdown is only about 
20% of the NMN production under aerobic conditions.  The rest of the cycle 
is eliminated during anaerobic growth by unknown reactions.  In pursuit of 
this major metabolic cycle we have isolated mutants for almost every known 
step of NAD synthesis and metabolism.  We have discovered two NAD kinases 
(producing NADP) which have different cofactor requirements and we have 
found that a deficit in NAD kinase leads to oxygen-sensitivity.  We have 
recently discovered a recycling activity (NMN deamidase) that depends on 
DNA ligase and acts only in the presence of oxygen.  Thus oxygen appears 
to be a major player in control and significance of the recycling pathway.

<h2>Adaptive mutation</h2>
We become involved in this controversial but very interesting area 
as a spinoff of an older notion of ours about mutagenic response to stress, namely 
that randomly formed local duplications and subsequently expanded arrays of genes may 
provide sufficient residual activity to allow growth, which in turn would 
allow for selection of useful mutations within a target set much larger 
than normally found in wild type.  In testing the 
idea, we discovered that the dominant system used by other laboratories to demonstrate 
"adaptive mutation" requires that the gene under selection be located on 
an F' plasmid and subject to transfer replication.  We are proceeding to 
look for evidence of "adaptive mutability" under less specialized 
conditions so we can more definitively test our model.
