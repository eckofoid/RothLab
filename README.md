## About The RADIO

This is the official blog of John Roth’s Laboratory. It uses a WordPress engine and is both powerful and relatively simple to use. Anybody who reads this blog can comment on existing posts. However, only registered users logged in can create new content.

## How to use it

Writing fresh entries is straightforward — click the “Site Admin” link on the right side of the page. This will take you to a busy page with an “Add New” link on the left in a box labelled “Posts”, which will bring up a simple editor in which you can compose your item.

Remember that, no matter where you are in the blog, you can always get back to the main page by clicking on “The RADIO” at the top of your current page.

Pick at least one category for your entry and be sure to deselect the generic “Uncategorized” category, an oxymoron if I ever heard one! Add tags, either preexisting or new. Categories and tags allow easy searching and sorting. Pushing the “Update Post” publishes your composition. Return to the main blog by clicking “The RADIO” at the top of the page.

It is to your advantage to be registered as a user, as it allows others to see who composed your posts. You may already be registered. As username, try your first name, last name, or your UCD email prefix (everything before the “@”). Use the server password initially. If that combination doesn’t work, see the current administrator, Eric.

Once you have successfully logged in, change your password. As before, click the “Site Admin” link, and then  “Your Profile” (left side). At the bottom of the page, you will find a change-password section. Your new password is known only to you. If you forget it, it can’t be recovered, although the administrator can create a new one.
